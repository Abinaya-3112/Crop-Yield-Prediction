# Crop-Yield-Prediction
This project demonstrates a data analysis and visualization workflow for predicting crop yields based on a dataset. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning techniques to provide insights into crop production over the years.

## Features
- Data preprocessing using Python and pandas.
- Visualization of crop production trends over time with matplotlib and seaborn.
- Implementation of a Random Forest Regressor for crop yield prediction.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
